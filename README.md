# James Loveridge

I am a front end developer with a wide experience of creating websites for small to large businesses. I worked as a self-employed designer/developer and now part of a team at a web agency. I am constantly looking to expand and improve my development knowledge.

I write HTML code in a clean and semantic manner, and with the BEM philosophy in Sass which in turn compiles into CSS. I have some exposure to JavaScript, PHP & MySQL. I am an advocate for accessibility, progressive enhancement and open source.

I maintain a personal project which revolves around British Birds of Prey. This website allows people who are not experts to be able to identify when they see one via the identify tool. During the internship at the Financial Times, I played an integral part in teaching British Sign Language to my colleagues.


## Skills

- **Front end:**  I have been writing HTML & CSS since 2000. I write code to be semantic, accessible and modular. I am an early adopter of the Sass workflow to produce CSS in a much quicker and time saving manner. I am improving my JavaScript all the time, by learning new techniques to use.

- **Back end:** My exposure to back end development focused on technologies like WordPress. This would involve writing custom functionality in PHP. I also used PHPMyAdmin or Sequel Pro to either write SQL queries or to maintain databases. I also have used Node.js to develop serverless websites (such as my own website).

## Employment

### Financial Times
_Engineer (Internal Products), April 2020 - present_

_Junior Engineer (Internal Products), October 2018 - March 2020_

### Xanda Ltd
_Developer, November 2016-October 2018_

**Technologies:** HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, Git, PHP, MySQL, WordPress, and Linux server management (nginx with CentOS).

**Role:** I developed bespoke WordPress websites for the web agency. The projects range from small to large websites which can involve eCommerce. Quite a few of the projects have custom functionality involved as well. I also maintained and monitored Linux servers, implemented SSL certificates (either purchased or LetsEncrypt) onto websites.

**Notable challenges:** Each project has its own requirements, which adds more complexity. I enjoyed figuring out and solving those unique challenges. I am focused on meeting the client's requirements on time.

### Financial Times
_Intern developer (Origami), March - June 2016_

**Technologies:** HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, Node.js & CircleCI.

**Role:** I worked with ~40 front end modules within the components library. I wrote documentation for Origami. I did code reviews on GitHub pull requests. This also includes providing support via GitHub Issues or Slack.

**Notable challenges:** One of the tasks whilst at Origami I enjoyed was converting the JavaScript to use the ES6 standard. I also overlooked the transition from Travis CI to CircleCI for each Origami component. Every module throws up different and interesting problems for me to debug and to fix. I also worked with a designer to develop responsive versions of the [o-table](https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-table/releases/tag/v5.0.0) component.


### Self-employed
_Web designer/developer, September 2010 - February 2016_

**Technologies:** HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Kirby & WordPress.

**Role:**  I worked as a designer first then later on as a developer. I worked with clients, and to fulfil their needs in a project. I also provided technical support after project completion.

**Notable challenges:** Each client comes with their own unique challenges. I aspire to overcome those challenges with positive, creative thinking and research. Every challenge has given something back to me to take to other future client projects.

### Sylvan Heights Bird Park
_Marketing Intern, March - May 2013_

**Role:** I volunteered at a non-profit organisation in North Carolina, USA. I worked with the marketing director. One of the tasks would be promoting the conservation of endangered bird species online. I took the initiative to improve the website, and to encourage more use of the social media. I also improved the content on the website that a wider range of the audience would be able to read and understand.

## Projects

- [British Birds of Prey](http://www.britishbirdsofprey.info): This was part of a web thesis project. This is a responsive website with progressive enhancement in mind. I built the project using Kirby with PHP & MySQL database for an identifying tool. Recently, I have decided to redevelop the project, and to put in place new techniques that I have learnt.

- [Pete’s Bikes](http://www.petesbikes.co.uk): A mail order website with a product catalogue online. I utilised WordPress with Custom Pages and Taxonomy for the product catalogue. After completion, the client’s business turnover has increased significantly. The website is still placing at the top of the Google UK search results under "Pete's Bikes" or "Pilgrim Pumps".
